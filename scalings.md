# **DIFFIRENCE BETWEEN HORIZONTAL SCALING AND VERTICAL SCALING:**
# SCALING:-
 Scaling is the ability to increase capacity by connecting various hardware and software units, so that they all work as a single logical unit.

 # Horizontal Scaling:-

 Horizontal scaling is a scaling where every work is distributed among different devices and all these devices are connected to a main device, as well as the work is done in the specific way on all devices. Basically its cheap and cost effective. Moreover it also known as scaling out.

# Vertical scaling:

Vertical scaling is a scaling where new additions of hardware and software are done in a single unit to increase its capacity. Its bit expensive than horizontal scaling, but easy to maintain and handle. However, its also known as  scaling in.
